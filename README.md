# Contiguous-sequential-pattern-mining

In this project we implement a contiguous sequential pattern mining algorithm and apply it on text data to mine potential phrase candidates. A contiguous sequential pattern is a sequence of items that frequently appears as a consecutive subsequence in a database of many sequences.

## Input Data
The provided input file ("Input_ raw_file_reviews.txt") consists of 10,000 online reviews from Yelp users. The reviews have been stemmed (to remove the postfix of each word so words with similar semantics can have the same form), and most of the punctuation has been removed. Therefore, each line is basically a list of strings separated by spaces.
